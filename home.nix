  # Home Manager needs a bit of information about you and the paths it should

  # compatible with. This helps avoid breakage when a new Home Manager release
  # introduces backwards incompatible changes.

  # want to update the value, then make sure to first check the Home Manager
  # release notes.

    # # fonts?
